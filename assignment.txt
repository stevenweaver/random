1. Read chapters 4,5, and 6 of Bioinformatics Data Skills
– After you complete the rest of the assignment, put all of your files in a folder on bioinformatics server (e.g. ~/compgen/week2)
– Make a GIT repository of this folder
– Make a text file copy of your git log (git log > mygitlog.txt) and include this text file with the other files as part of your gzip archive
2. Use samtools faidx to sample 100,000 bp from the same region of both copies of one of the Venter chromosomes.
– Venter chromosomes are in :/usr/local/ventergenomes
– Sample 100,000 base pairs from the same region of each (avoid the beginning and ends of the chromosome files has they have lots of N’s)
3. Write a python program to simulate fastq file short-read data from your two fasta files (for the 100,000 regions)
– The program should sample evenly from all portions of the file, and should sample both strands (i.e. sequence and its reverse complement)
evenly
– The output file will be in fastq format with each read appearing as one sequence (i.e. 4 lines in the file)
– The quality line in the fastq file should just be a sequence of “I” symbols (capital letter i ) – there is no quality info in this case
– The program should take 4 command line arguments: 1) Input filename 2) Output filename (the fastq filename) 3) Length of the reads 4) Depth of
coverage (e.g. 10)
4. Use your program to sample each of your two sample fasta files with 100bp reads and 10X coverage.
5. Use the ART program (already installed) to sample each of your files with 100bp reads and 10X coverage.
– Read the instructions: art_illumina_README.txt (on CANVAS)
– Use HS20 (HiSeq 2000) sequencing system
6. Run the fastqc program (already installed) on each of your four fastq files
7. Write a one to two page summary of how the ART results and your simulation results compare in:
– Per base sequence content
– Per sequence GC content
– Per base N content
– Sequence Length Distribution
– Sequence Duplication Levels
– Overrepresented sequences
– Kmer Content
8. Turn in a gzipped archive containing the following 6 files (clearly named):
1. Two chromosome samples (fasta files)
2. Python program
3. Two files with simulated data generated using your python program
4. Two files with simulated data generated using ART
5. Your one page summary of fastqc results
6. The text file with your git log (from step 1)
