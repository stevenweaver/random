# Per base sequence content

## chr22_157501105

### ART
Per base sequence content hovered around 28% for both adenine and thymine,  and
22% for both cytosine and guanine.

### Custom
Per base sequence content were a bit different. 30% for adenine, 26% for
thymine, 22% for both cytosine and guanine. The discrepancy may come from not
weighting what kind of substitution can be made when introducing read errors.

# Per sequence GC content

## chr22_157501105

### ART

The theoretical distribution has a mu of 48%.

### Custom

The theoretical distribution has a mu of 37%. However, the shape of the actual
distribution is not all that different. The GC content in my simulation does not
have as high of a peak around 51%.
